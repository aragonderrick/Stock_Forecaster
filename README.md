# Stock_Forecaster
## A web app that displays open and closing prices of any user selected stock. 
## The app takes advantage of pythons Dash framework from Plotly for the front end and Yfinance and sklearn for the backend.
## The app allows users to input a ticker and a dat time range for any stock.
## The company information will be displayed alongside a chart showing the opening and closing prices for that given timerange.
## An additional feature of the application involves the Support Vector Regression(SVR) Machine Learning Algorithm.
##     (https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/03/support-vector-regression-tutorial-for-machine-learning/)
## This algorithm is used to train the model on the last 90 days worth of closing prices for the user selected stock and use this data
## to predict the closing prices for the next 'user-selected' amount of days.
